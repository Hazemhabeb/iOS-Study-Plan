# ðŸš€ iOS Journey â€” Hazem Habeb

Welcome to my public learning journal as I work towards becoming an **iOS Master Engineer**.

Over the next several weeks, Iâ€™ll be reviewing and leveling up across four key areas:

1. **iOS Development Mastery** â€“ UIKit, SwiftUI, architecture, debugging, testing, etc.
2. **Computer Science Foundations** â€“ Data structures, algorithms, system design
3. **Leadership Skills** â€“ Code review, mentoring, agile, communication
4. **Interview Preparation** â€“ Problem solving, app architecture discussions, tech questions
